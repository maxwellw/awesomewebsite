						About Me
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Hi! I'm Max, and I am a fresh-out-of-college engineer who is a relentless self-improver.
						A mechanical engineer with a depth in mechatronics by degree, I have grown to love the relationship between hardware and software. Smart hardware, if you will.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm currently a software engineer at Delphi Labs in Silicon Valley, where I have the opportunity to expand and solidify my skillset while working on awesome projects such as autonomous vehicles and the automotive experience. 
					</p>
					<p>
					  Alongside work, I also have some time to work on fun side projects (this website, for example!) where I get to build whatever mechatronic ideas that come to mind. If you have any ideas for interesting projects, I would love to hear them!
					</p>

						Background
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Before starting my career, I attended Stanford starting in September 2009. Along my four-year learning adventure, I :
					</p>
					
					<ul id="learnList">
						<li> Met and worked with countless driven, capable, and intelligent peers </li>
						<li> Had the support of both professors and peers in learning how to learn</li>
						<li> Made both great friends and solid connections </li>
						<li> Worked on an extraordinary amount of hands-on, team-based, and applicable engineering projects</li>
						<li> Interned at Apple, assisting in automation engineering</li>
						<li> Graduated with a BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering in December 2013</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						Born on December 20th, 1991 in New York, I lived in both New York and Florida before settling for most of my youth in New Mexico. Alongside my academics and engineering hobbies, I also dabbed into ultimate frisbee, running, chess, and competitive online gaming - most of which I am still interested in today.
