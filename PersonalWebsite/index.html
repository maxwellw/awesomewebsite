							ME218D: Volkswagen Audi Mechatronics Project
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I took ME218D in my last quarter at Stanford to cap off the mechatronics series and to be exposed to real corporate projects. 
							I worked with Cliff Bargar and Erin Watson on a project with the Volkswagen Audi Electronics Research Lab in Belmont, California. 
							We were tasked with creating a full solution using a mobile device to ultimately control a car's functions.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We worked from the ground up and researched CAN bus communication along with Bluetooth Low Energy chips and implementations on iOS/Android. 
							Our final prototype was a completely working automotive-grade custom PCB that had a Freescale XDP512 microcontroller and a BLE112 chip. 
							We used SPI to communicate between the two chips on board and BLE112's BGScript to communicate with an Android application that we made.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Along with all the functionality, VW/Audi wanted a solution that would require less than 100 uA of current when the car is off so the battery doesn't run out when someone leaves their car. 
							When disconnected, our PCB used less than 40 uA of current and would wake up in less than 50ms.
							Our electronic parts also had to be automotive grade, so we sourced all of our hardware based on automotive grade and low power consumption.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Check out the report <a class="fileLink" href="VW-CAN-Report.pdf">here</a>. Feel free to contact me with any questions about the project!

							ME218B: Mechatronics and Autonomous Robots
						</p>
						
						<p>
							ME218B at Stanford was the second class in the mechatronics series where we explored more depth in micro-controllers and communication protocols.
							In three weeks near the end of the quarter, I worked with Dustin Gerrard, Michelle Tsai, and Erin Watson to create an awesome autonomous robot!
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Our autonomous robot was designed to play a robot-battleship game, where we would sink ships, reload, and disrupt the enemy's reloading in an 8'x8' field. 
							The project incorporated an eye-in-the-sky that would read fiducials and answer wireless queries about the state of the field. 
							Our bot would then take the information that it received to both navigate itself and also aim at ships. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We needed to be able to shoot nerf balls over the wall to sink ships, so we used a miniature flywheel made out of duron with a feeding mechanism. 
							The flywheel turned out to be extremely accurate and we managed to achieve a >99% accuracy rate on targets which allowed our bot to perform very well. 
							Along with the shooting, our bot needed to be able to aim at an IR signal (which we did by mounting an IR sensor on the turret), and reload by sending an IR signal while lined up at the base station.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Overall, our bot performed very consistently and achieved the check-off for the class with everything working as planned.

							ME218C: Universally Controlled Robots and Controllers
						</p>
						
						<p>
							ME218C at Stanford was the third class in the mechatronics series. Our class learned more about wireless communication and gained more experience working on team projects.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							During spring quarter, we concentrated more on lower level microcontroller architecture (ex. assembly language, memory) and wireless communications. 
							Our final project this quarter was to create both a creative controller and a moving robot, but with the catch that anyone's controller could control anyone's robot.
							To do so, our class put together a committee consisting of a person from each team to decide on the wireless communication standard. 
							
						</p>
							Our bot, Funny Bunny (based on the previous quarter's team name - Bunny Bombers) incorporated a grabber and a camera pivot that a user could rotate to check surroundings. 
							It also managed to traverse the "planet"'s rough terrain (carpet on foam) without much trouble, after fixing a current draw issue.

							ME218A: Mechatronics and Arcade Games
						</p>
						
						<p>
							ME218A at Stanford was the beginning of the graduate mechatronics series at Stanford and covered the basic circuits, embedded programming, and more mechatronics concepts.
							For the last third of the class, My team (Dustin Gerrard, Abhishek Sahasrabudhe, Michelle Tsai) and I were tasked with creating a Batman-themed arcade game in three weeks. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Our two-player cooperative puzzle/interactive game incorporated and reacted to IR sensors and receivers, analog dials, buttons, and touch sensors to detect user inputs and advance through the adventure.
							The system's brains were two Freescale C32 class micro-controllers that controlled each player's sensors and actuators and then communicated with each other to play through the game.

							CS229: Machine Learning applied to Poker
						</p>
						
						<p>
							In Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class, I teamed up with James Bensson and Alex Eckert to try and predict a player's hand strength based on their betting behavior.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							We believed that there would be a significant connection between a player's betting in a round and how strong their hand at the river is, so we gathered data from both computer poker bots and real human games.
							After figuring out how to parse each database into formats that we could use, we went to work on extracting features.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Our end goal was to predict a player's river "hand rank", which is defined as the percentage of 2 card hands that the player's hand rank would beat. For example, 
							
							
							
						</p>
						<p>
							The player's hand rank is .838, which means his hand will beat 83.8% of other possible hands. 
							However, there are still 16.2% of hands that his pair of aces will lose to, such as two pairs, three of a kind, straights, and so on.
						</p>
						<p>
							At first, we kept our features extremely simple:
							
							<ul>
								<li>Number of checks before the river</li>
								<li>Number of calls before the river</li>
								<li>Number of bets before the river</li>
								<li>Number of raises before the river</li>
							</ul>
							
							But as we interperted more data, we added on:
							
							<ul>
								<li>Value of bets/raises compared to the current pot amount</li>
								<li>Ratios of aggressive moves to defensive moves</li>
								<li>Average bet in each round compared to the pot amount</li>
							</ul>
							
							We found that the value of bets/raises improved our model a lot, and especially for the Naive Bayes model.
							
						</p>
						
						<p>
							In the end, we had a Naive Bayes algorithm coupled with clustering that could predict the exact bin (out of 6) a player's river hand was in 60% of the time, and the average bin error was less than 1 bin.

							ME113: Neurosky Controlled Robot
						</p>
						
						<p>
							For my senior design corporate project, we were tasked by Neurosky to create a mechanical device that was controlled by their EEG device. 
							We decided to make a motorized platform that could be controlled solely by someone's head. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							While working on the project, we quickly found that the Neurosky was no good for actively controlling any moving device due to the slow refresh rates and difficulty of control of its concentration and meditation measurements.
							Although it would have been good for data gathering, we could only use it for mode changes and such. We wrote some algorithms using a built in blinking detection system to change state and control modes based on double/triple blinks.
